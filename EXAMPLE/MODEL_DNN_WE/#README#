		                # if learning_rate < 0, welearning_rate >0
				#     update WE, but not weight of network
				#     updated WE will be saved as epoch***.autosave.we
				# if learning_rate > 0, welearning_rate >0
				#     update WE, and weight of network
				#     updated WE will be saved as epoch***.autosave.we
				# if learning_rate > 0, welearning_rate <0
				#     just use WE, only update weight of network
